# QTI Generation

## What does it do?
This will generate a CSV file containing download links for QTI files for quizzes in a course. You supply a file with the course and quiz IDs for which you want download links.

## Getting Started
Create a csv file with course IDs in one column and quiz IDs in the next column. Save this file as quizIDs.csv and place it in the same folder as Generate-QTI-Files.py
