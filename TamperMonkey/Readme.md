# Project Title

Show the Gauge button to select users

## What does it do?
The Gauge icon is visible to all users when it is installed. We added some javascript to hide it from everyone in our Global JS file. This code will unhide it if you want particular people to be able to see it.

## Getting Started

Before trying to use this, you should install Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. Just copy the code into a new script and modify the parameters as needed for your institution. The external tool number will be different for each Canvas install.
